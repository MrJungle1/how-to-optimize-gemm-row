# how-to-optimize-gemm-row-major

This project is based on [blis-lab](https://github.com/flame/blislab) documentation and [project](https://github.com/flame/how-to-optimize-gemm) implementation, which is different from the original work in:
Originally used as **column-major sequence** `x86 SSE` code. this project is based on ** row main sequence** `gemm` optimization;
